# üê∫ Balto-TypeScript

Balto is Smart and Fast:

* Runs your TypeScript compilation with your settings and versions to make sure that everything compiles correctly
* Supports ignoring specific errors using [tsc-silent](https://github.com/evolution-gaming/tsc-silent)

Sample config (place in `.github/workflows/balto.yml`):

```yaml
name: Balto-TypeScript

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: # may not be necessary, see note below
      contents: read
      checks: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      # Optional but may be helpful depending on the ESLint plugins your project uses
      - uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          # Change to package-lock.json if using npm in your own project
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - uses: planningcenter/balto-typescript@v0.1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## A note about permissions

Because some tools, like [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot), use tokens for actions that have read-only permissions, you'll need to elevate its permissions for this action to work with those sorts of tools. If you don't use any of those tools, and your workflow will only run when users with permissions in your repo create and update pull requests, you may not need these explicit permissions at all.

When defining any permissions in a workflow or job, you need to explicitly include any permission the action needs. In the sample config above, we explicitly give `write` permissons to the [checks API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/checks/runs) for the job that includes balto-eslint as a step. Because balto-eslint uses [check runs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-checks-api), the `GITHUB_TOKEN` used in an action must have permissions to create a `check run`. You'll also need `contents: read` for `actions/checkout` to be able to clone the code.
